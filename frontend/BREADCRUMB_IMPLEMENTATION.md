## Technical Implementation

### Schema Structure
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
  "itemListElement": [
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 1,
      "name": "Home",
      "item": "https://dnsworth.com"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 2,
      "name": "[Page Name]",
      "item": "https://dnsworth.com/[page-url]"
    }
  ]
}
